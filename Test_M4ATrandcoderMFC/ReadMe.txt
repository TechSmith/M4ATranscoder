## About
This is a simple little executable, or harness, to test the functionality of WavToM4A.dll.

It allows you to do many things such as:
* Choose both input and output locations
* Transcode the input to the output
* See progress on your transcode
* Cancel your transcode
* Get list of available output formats
* Choose the output format that is desireable

We hope you like it! :)
